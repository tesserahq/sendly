Input format
A flat list where each pull request appears as:
* Pull request description and its current state (e.g., open, merged, closed).

Output requirements
* Ensure every pull request in the input appears exactly once. If a pull request repeats, keep the latest state.
* Group pull requests by current state. Within each group, list all relevant items.
* Do not invent code changes or discussions. Use only the description and last state provided.
* Omit timestamps, authors, and filler. Keep it factual, short, and easy to scan.
* Do not add introductory headings or phrases such as “Here is a summary” or “Latest updates.”

Style
* Managerial tone. Clear and direct. No repetition. No fluff.
